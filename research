Gann: Used three methods:
Progression method, learn from Jensen - it has limitations. Can be successful.
Planetry cycles - synodic,COR
Number cycles - Octaves,counting.

Square of 9:
Dr ruth miller has written a book called Square of 9 - corn method, it’s the correct method & very simple

Handbook of Trend Determination:
Rule number 12 states:
Whenever you read a book following pages are important 
40-42, 70-72, 80-82, page 123, 144. The Gist of the story is lying in these pages. Bayer found it in lot of ancient works.

Real Gann:

All about cycles —> This is the correct path

Cycle is everything is stock market.. 

Market is not chaotic if you know the cycles + mathematics to calculate them..

Remember there is no shortcut, increase your vibration.. 
Get the tools to understand Gann, it takes time to understand & build up 

Lunar cycle
COR
LOV
Inversion cycle
How does Octaves work

Price Method (Pocket radio is one of the price method in tunnel)
SQ9,Wheels

No doubt gann is simple, but you need to have proper background


Select a script which vibrates with you.. how to find it out ?
You need to trade multiple stocks see which one makes money for you..
Find 3 stock and 3 commodities that likes you.. *

——————————————
In the tunnel through the air everything is mentioned, but you need to decode it.

SQ9 is just mentioned 1 1/2 page..

Master time factor is a number… will only work along with cycles
To get the cycle you need to prepare..

You can just make money only by using his lunar cycle.. Free in his website..

Six steps to gann:

Time Cycles

Step1:
Find the Small Cycle - (Moon/Luncar Cycles)
Step2: 
Get the inversion into the cycle, (It will double check the cycle)
Step3:
Add large cycle to this cycle
Step4: 
The inversions into the large cycle
Step5:
Add in the lone aviator cycle, ( that’s a good trading friend)
Step6:
Price on the cycles! This is the other Crosshair and is better than ORB!

Every cycle has it’s own price systems

Inversion check can be done in 3 steps:
BA is using 1 shortcut to do it.

I began understanding that Gann’s cycles are coded in Days in that book, although there are a few yearly references.  *

Page numbers in Tunnel DO correlate with a code but the code is not random and MUST be tied into elements that are repeated in the book. See at this point I had learned that important parts or points are repeated. An example of this is the Tele-Talk which was deliberately invented twice. You need the Tele-Talk, you need to have it working to truly understand L.O.V. So there is an order, a technique, if you will to the coding. Learn the techniques and Tunnel is not so hard. *

In this regard I would say to study the Demon of Death very carefully in Tunnel. Gann actually writes a lot on inversions in Tunnel, going to great lengths to deal with them, but like so many other things its really useless without the cycle.

In being completely honest it took me a couple of years to master the radium ray. 

Gann wrote in Tunnel that the wonderful inventions the Atlantians had are due to repeat. He states this on page 76, which is an important page number. People have all sorts of opinions and their opinions directly affect their lives. 

Study the “Tunnel Machines” especially in Detroit.

There are 2 master numbers that each individual has. One is their “inner birth number” which is the day of birth. Like if you were born May 6 1961, the 6th is your inner birth number. The other critical number is your name number. You add up your name. Like if your name is John. J=1, O=6, H=8, and N=5. Adding those numbers together you get 20. You use the name that people call you

My master numbers are 29 = 2 & name = 7

s	1	
i	9	
m	4	
o	6	
n	5	2
	25	7

Gann’s Time Cycles have lengths, which are governed by certain measurements. They work a certain way and there is definitely a rhythm. You have to get at least one of his time cycles working to be able to forecast Highs and Lows, like Gann, Bayer, and Jensen. This is step one! Things like inversions, price etc.


Starting out with the notebook, take every invention and write down what is said about it and also the page numbers it is mentioned on. One invention is “Marie the Angel of Mercy” which we call MAM for short. So at the top of the notebook page we would write MAM then go through Tunnel first writing the page number (page 234) and what was said about it (work was started on the new machine with all secrecy, it had already been christened “Marie the Angel of Mercy”). Next you want to find and isolate a DATE for the event. Page 233 has “Fall of 1928” then page 234 has early September 1928. So the actual date must be presumed to be early September 1928, and because Gann did not specifically provide us with a date, we can assume this to be important because Gann made us work for it. Think like this! “How would Gann hide his time cycles which all have a length of time to repeat?”

We then would go looking for the next time “Marie the Angel of Mercy” is listed. Once we find it we write down the page number, what is said, and the date or at least as close as we can get to the date using what Gann gives us. This process is repeated until all the times MAM is mentioned are put into our notebook in the above manner. Once this process is complete on MAM we can go and do our unofficial configuring on our white board sheets. Playing around with dates, putting together, comparing and looking at the distance the planets moved, number of DAYS between mentioning etc. Yes, dear reader, this is the road that leads one to success.

This type of analysis can lead to success at finding the cycles, for Gann not only gives you the cycles but the Planets that are involved. If an airplane does not have a pilot (aviator) it is of the nature of cycles that do not use the planets. It’s a higher level system. The longitude and latitude for every city mentioned should be obtained by the seeker. RULE; There is little, if any, “filler” in this book. If a city is mentioned its important. If a date is mentioned its important. NO EXCEPTIONS! Poor Robert Gordon “cotton head” starts out being teased by his brother, then works his way up to “Supreme Commander.” At different phases of his life, depending on what he is called, he is different things! So are the other characters. Each name that is mentioned in the book is important. Both Gann and Jensen mention Descartes, with Gann cloaking him in the book. Pythagoras is mentioned saying something weird about women on page 191 “there are in a woman’s eyes two sorts of tears, one of grief the other of deceit.” Pythagoras was a mathematician so the line is suspect. Decoded it means “two sorts of tears, one”. This 2:1 ratio is the Octave, so he is saying study Pythagoras and Octaves! When I found, what I thought was a cycle, never did I ask someone “Is this a cycle, figuring if I asked that I had no real knowledge of it.” If you do not know if you have a cycle or not, you probably don’t. The way to find out is easy. Your cycle will go H, L, H, L etc. with an occasional inversion (about 10% of the time). If you have a cycle that inverts 40% of the time you have coincidence. Remember the master key; you MUST have an accurate TIME cycle first, before ANY other thing will work! The time cycle must have come from Tunnel, to be one of Gann’s TRUE cycles. Once you find them expect your life to begin to change! Gann’s cycles will allow you to forecast and that is step one. Gann will emphasize certain parts in the book with Capitals, and the use of words like great or gigantic, these relate to critical areas. This work was started on Robert Gordon’s 110th birthday. Certain things act as “hubs” in the book such as the 110 story building which is used in no less than 3 different calculations in the book! Another hub or tie in is the GIGANTIC attack on New York City. Tunnel was written at a specific resonant frequency. When one matches that frequency the book literally coughs up her secrets! Although ever so slowly in the beginning, becoming faster and faster. 

Price systems in tunnel:*
Some will seek to understand how W.D. Gann’s price systems work with the cycles, and if you have one of Gann’s time cycles this is certainly a valuable study. I would suggest studying the Cotton Campaign and The Tunnel machines.

Inversion Study:
Another avenue that will probably appeal to some after finding their first cycle is to understand W.D. Gann’s inversion solution. The Gann Traders I know for the most part believe that inversions will take a little longer to understand than price. I will tell you dear reader, in this regard, I feel strongly that the letter that Robert believed Marie dropped in Paris must first be interpreted before a success can be had with inversions. The true cause of inversions is a cycle that adds in extra pivots, from time to time, to the main cycle. Inversions are nature’s way of keeping all the cycles in sync.

BA-tips
In tunnel Marie the angle of mercy[mam] is more than on thing..
In tunnel gang used the word “mountain” to  mean up, so in reference to to a planet it would not be longitude
In tunnel Roberts illness are there to show.a specific cycle
In Tunnel the EDWARD Mason jealousy is important as a marker for something.
In Tunnel the bible quotes are there because GANN wants to have access to specifically what he is referring too. Also he kind of. “ADDS” on someplace.
In Tunnel when Edna uses the SPITFIRE it is very important and marks something different than when Robert uses “IT”
In Tunnel FIDES INTREPEDA is not 266! And that is NO TYPO!
In Tunnel PAGE 234 Correlates with Jensens Square in his books, except a little larger.
In Tunnel note that around CAIRO GANN was not using the pattern chart but a different square which could rise to greater heights.
In Tunnel Robert goes down to 110th floor
Chapter 30 has 18 pages. No way that is coincidence.

Price works in circles, this is one of the major points of post 39059. Jensen handles this on pages 107 to 109 of his book. Furthermore future price points originate from past price points, that is the secret. “

Ancient Wisdom of Chinese Tonic Herbs by Ron Teeguarden 
“The millionaire Course” by Shatki Gawain 
Mark Fisher, did a sequel entitled “The Millionaires Secrets.” This is a very powerful book for those that are meeting with resistance in their lives, for those that feel they should be further along than what they are.
